### ðŸ’¡ Wait a minute!. What do ojpro means?
Nice question!. Because you "know" that my name is Oussama El Jabbari and I Love Programming, I mixed those words to make this name where:
+ o => Oussama
+ j => Jabbari
+ pro => Programming

`Good, but where is the "EL"?`

Yeah, I forget it ðŸ˜‰, May I include it in the next version ðŸ™ƒ.
